DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulations
A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

Document interface, selectors: querySelector(), getElementById().

addEventListener() method sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target.

Element.classList - read-only property
Element.classList.remove - Removes the specified class values;
Element.classList.add - Adds the specified class values, ignored if class doesn't exist.
